Algorithm 2: GA optimizer 
Input: Preprocessed data and GA parameters (population_size, generations).
Output: The best-found neural network architecture and its performance.
BEGIN
    // Phase 1: Initialization
    1. Initialize population using Initialize_Population()
    2. Set generation = 0
    3. Initialize statistics tracking variables
    // Phase 2: Initial Population Evaluation
    4. FOR each individual in population DO
       4.1. Build model using individual's chromosome
       4.2. fitness = Fitness_Evaluation(individual, X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val)
       4.3. Record evaluation statistics
    // Phase 3: Generation Loop
    5. FOR generation = 1 to max_generations DO
    // Phase 4: Evolution Step
       5.1. new_population = Population_Evolution (population)
    // Phase 5: New Individual Evaluation
       5.2. FOR each new individual in new_population DO
            5.2.1. IF individual not yet evaluated THEN
             Build model and evaluate fitness
         5.2.2. Record evaluation statistics
    // Phase 6: Statistics Update
       5.3. current_best = individual with maximum fitness
       5.4. Record generation statistics
       5.5. Update population = new_population
    // Phase 7: Final Evaluation
    6. best_individual = individual with highest fitness across all generations
    7. Evaluate best_individual on test set
    8. Generate comprehensive results report
    9. Return results dictionary with best individual and statistics
