Algorithm 4: Fitness Evaluation	
Input: Individual I, Training data (X_train, y_train), Validation data (X_val, y_val)
Output: Fitness score, Performance metrics
ALGORITHM: Evaluate_Fitness(I, X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val)
BEGIN
    // Phase 1: Model Construction
   1. Build neural network model from I's chromosome encoding
   2. Compile model with Adam optimizer using I.parameters['learning_rate']
    // Phase 2: Model Training
   3. Train model on X_train, y_train for fixed epochs
    // Phase 3: Model Evaluation
    4. Evaluate trained model on validation set X_val, y_val
   5. Calculate validation accuracy as fitness score
   6. Calculate precision, recall, F1-score metrics
    // Phase 4: Result Return
   7. Return fitness score and performance metrics
